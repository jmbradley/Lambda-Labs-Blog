# Week One Look Back

Being the kick off for the project, our team needed to ensure a smooth start for the project. We discussed in depth the importance of planning and the necessity to develop a plan that was static enough to be reliable but also organic such that it could evolve as the work load necessitated. Additionally, our group is constructed of 3 full stack and 2 iOS devs. This was considered carefully as we thought about how to proceed. I will reference this later in the description of the PRs.

The first day we spent planning out our data table for our database. Patrick put together a couple of visuals to based on our conversations. These aided us in understanding how to situate our foreign keys within the context of the rest of our data.

Casey peeled off to organize the front end so that we could seemlessly move into that after the db came together. We decided to put two engineers on the db because a successful implementation was crucial for the entirety of the group.

This was quite helpful as we moved into the subsequent days. Particularly as Patrick and I built our migrations. As we began to wrap this task, I started working on re-arranging our endpoints into routes and models. We did decided to do this as a group such that we could design our project for scalability. As we enter the homestretch, we will need to be working across a variety of files. If something breaks (which it will) we wanted to have thought as much about containment as we could. Thus we elected to execute a model/route architecture. Unfortunately, while I was able to complete the build of the models and routes, I was not able to get them live. After a discussing the best approach to implementation, we decided on rolling our end points over piece meal. That will happen over the next few weeks.
